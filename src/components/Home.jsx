            Mental health refers to an individual's emotional, psychological, and social well-being, which affects how they think, feel, and act, and helps determine how they handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. It is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood. Mental health is the state of cognitive and behavioral well-being, and it is also used to refer to the absence of mental disease. Good mental health is when an individual feels positive about themselves and copes well with everyday pressures. One in five people in Northern Ireland will experience potential mental health problems.
